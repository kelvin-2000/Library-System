# Frontend Programming Language and Framework Selection for the Advanced Library Management System (Next.js)

## Advanced Library Management System (ALMS)
## Technology Choice for Frontend
## Context and Problem Statement

The Advanced Library Management System needs to support multiple user roles such as Library Member and Admin, and handle a large amount of data including transactions and queries. 
It now requires a scalable, efficient, and responsive back-end and front-end frameworks for the chosen three-tier or n-tier architecture (Presentation, Business Logic, and Data Layers, etc).
The development of the Advanced Library Management System is carried out by our team, and a suitable front-end framework will be chosen after careful consideration. 
The solution needs to give great productivity to the developers, integrate seamlessly with backend and the chosen database system, and offer great performance for the users. The framework should ideally have a strong ecosystem and support server-side rendering.

## Decision Drivers

* { Decision Driver 1, e.g., Performance and Scalability: The framework needs to be able to handle increased load as the library management system grows with the increased number of users.}
* { Decision Driver 2, e.g., Server-side Rendering Capabilities: The framework should give great server-side rendering to improve initial page load times and search engine optimization.}
* { Decision Driver 3, e.g., Ecosystem and community support: The chosen framework should have a big ecosystem with plenty of community support.}
* { Decision Driver 4, e.g., Integration: The frontend should be able to integrate seamlessly with the chosen Backend and Database systems.}
* { Decision Driver 5, e.g., Developer Experience and Productivity: The chosen framework should give great performance and experience for the users, and should be able to handle the increasing load.}

## Considered Options

* Next.js
* Blazor
* Angular
* Vue.js

## Decision Outcome

## Chosen Option: Next.js (Front-end)

* The advanced Library Management System requires a robust, lightweight and modular architecture, thus,Next.js for front-end was chosen, as it also has a unified Javascript codebase.
* Next.js would provide responsive, fast and interactive presentation layer.
* This framework with their strong community support and resources satisfy the needs of a robust, scalable, secure library system.
* Next.js was chosen since the language has some of the best server-side rendering capabilities, productivity and performance in the industry. 
* Even though the other frameworks offer interesting capabilities, Next.js performance advantages and mature ecosystem is a better choice for the Advanced Library Management System with all its advantages.


### Consequences

* Good, because both frontend and backend frameworks use Javascript and thus, simplifies development, thus, it is easier to learn and maintain.
* Good, because the frameworks are lightweight and modular, thus can support horizontal scaling and has high performance.
* Good, because the large communities for both frameworks help in long-term maintainability and stability.
* Bad, because Next.js's server-side rendering can add complexity for highly interactive features.

### Confirmation

Code and design reviews with team members after getting appropriate feedback from stakeholders will ensure the proper integration and alignment of various technologies, systems and architecture used for the system. 
Express.js, Next,js, together with MySQL will help create a highly-functional, robust, secure, scalable Advanced Library Management System and meet all the requirements. 
Performance tests of API endpoints and Loading times will verify their effectiveness, ensuring they meet all the necessary requirements.


## Pros and Cons of the Options

### Next.js (Next.js, n.d.) (Dakowicz, 2024)

* Good, because it gives great developer experience intuitive routing, and hot module replacement.
* Good, because the ecosystem of tools and libraries is big, and support important things like TypeScript and TailwindCSS.
* Good, because it offers server-side rendering capabilities without causing any performance issues.
* Neutral, because developers need to know React first, which could have some effect on development time, as unfamiliar developers would need time to learn this.

### Blazor (SoftIQ, n.d.)

* This is a reliable Microsoft stack with ASP.NET Core as back-end and Blazor with C# on the front-end which would result in a high-performance system.

* Good, because it is great for integration with .NET backend systems.
* Good, because it also has server-side and client-side rendering options.
* Good, because it can be used to develop interactive web UIs in frontend using C# instead of Javascript.
* Bad, because it can have longer load times.
* Bad, because it has a smaller ecosystem with limited support and community when compared to JavaScript.

### Angular (Radkovsky & Myzyka, 2024)

* Good, because it has strong Typescript support, is platform-agnostic, and major features include server-side rendering and lazy loading.
* Good, because it gives a complete framework with built-in tools for most necessary things like forms, state management, routing, two-way data binding, etc.
* Bad, because it can be slower when compared with frameworks like Next,js because it has a bigger bundle size.
* Bad, because it could pose a greater challenge for the developers that are not already familiar with it.

### Vue.js (Alex Soft, 2022)

* Good, because it has flexible architecture and gives great performance.
* Good, because it has a smaller learning curve and easier to integrate with its smaller size.
* Bad, because it doesnâ€™t have built-in server-side capabilities, and requires and needs additional packages and setup.
* Bad, because it has a smaller ecosystem than React or Angular.


## More Information

The team has agreed on using Next,js for the frontend of the system. The decision will be revisited in 6 months to ensure that the requirements are being fulfilled and an effective system is in use. More features to add will also be discussed then.
